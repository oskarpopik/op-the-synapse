# oskarpopik-lunar-lander

This is a variation of the Lunar Lander game. The game mimics the release of neurotransmitters between two neuron cells in a synapse. When a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic neuron binds to the postsynaptic neuron an electric impulse is generated. This process enables comunication between the brain cells.

Use arrow keys to control the dopamine molecule and try to bind with the receptor.
